SHORT TERM:

GENERAL:

(See TO DO List of The app: https://github.com/Z-Anatomy/The-app/tree/PC-Version)

    -SUMMARIZE THE DEFINITIONS in English and adapt the names to the latest nomenclature
    -TRANSLATE THE DEFINITIONS with the latest official nomenclature in each language (https://tinyurl.com/yckcx6zy)
    -ADD THE SYNONYMS in each language (the structures can be found in the app based on their synonyms)
    -CREATE BONUS COLLECTIONS and list their contents. Ex: 'Trunk' refers to anatomical structures of several systems
    -SIMPLIFY THE MATERIALS AND SCRIPT: Blender only remains as a workshop; all the functions won't need to work inside Blender.
    -RE-ORDER THE LABELS to correctly represent the parenthood relationships between labels (currently all shown as siblings)
    -REPLACE ALL THE MESHES' NAMES WITH THE ANATOMICAL ID: These 4-digit codes could prevent many mistakes if the app can adapt to it. (This needs to be discussed with a developer)

CORRECT AND COMPLETE THE MALE MODEL:

    -LIST AND DESCRIBE THE MODIFICATIONS REQUIRED or validate the content (by a radiologist?)
    -CORRECT THE MODEL based on these descriptions
    -CREATE AND INTEGRATE THE MISSING STRUCTURES
    -FINAL VALIDATION

MIDTERM:

CREATE A FEMALE HUMAN MODEL

    -CREATE A SURFACE SCAN OF A MODEL standing in anatomical position
    -SUBTRACT THE BACK OF THE SCAN from a semi-rigid foam mattress
    -CREATE A CT-SCAN of the model lying in this mattress for the skeleton
    -CREATE AN MRI in the same position for the soft tissues (If the width is too big, the limbs on one of the two sides can be ignored.)
    -EXPORT A 3D MODEL OF THE SKELETON FROM THE SCAN
    -CREATE AN AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION OF THE SCAN AND MRI using TotalSegmentator, and the other AI tools from 3DSlicer to guide the modeling.
    -DERIVE THE 3D FEMALE MODEL from the male model
    -CREATE AND INTEGRATE THE FEMALE ANATOMICAL PARTS (- INTEGRATE THIS MODEL IN THE APP with an option to switch between them (This needs to be discussed with a developer)

LONGTERM:

VETERINARY ANATOMY (HORSE, PIG, COW, DOG, CAT, CHICKEN, RAT, (GORILLA)):

    -CREATE A SURFACE SCAN OF MOUNTED SKELETONS (In position + disassemble, scan each bone and reassemble)
    -AND/OR CT-SCAN/MRI A LIVE ANIMAL
    -MODEL THE MUSCLES and the other systems
    -CREATE THE DEFINITIONS of the veterinary anatomical structures
    -CREATE THE CORRESPONDENCES BETWEEN THE HUMAN AND VETERINARY LEXICONS (TA2 & NAV) allowing to switch a dissection between the human and the non-human animals.

((EMBRYOLOGY

    -CORRECT AND TRANSLATE THE TERMINOLOGIA EMBRYOLOGICA (TE)
    -CREATE THE DEFINITIONS of the embryological anatomical structures
    -NEGOTIATE THE ACCESS TO THE EXISTING MODEL (https://www.3dhumandevelopment.com/)
    -ORGANIZE AND COMPLETE THESE MODELS using the same principles as for the human model))
